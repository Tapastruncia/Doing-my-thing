# My experiment on time tracking

### Time is your most precious asset

And the most ephemeral without a doubt 🦋.
The fact that I have **limited time on this earth** has always concerned me and made me extremely aware of the hour, place and activity I was performing at any given situation (let's not forget that feeling of "_I am not doing enough and time just slips away!_").

Fortunately, as I've grown a little bit older I've learnt to enjoy the present moment and use my time more **wisely and mindfully**. 

<p>&nbsp;<p>
 
### What I'm doing

With that goal in mind, I've decided to track my time in a very visual way so I will be able to see patterns and make decisions accordingly. This is what they call **_data visualization_** and **_data-driven decision making_**. You got to love it 💘 

I got the inspiration from [someone I follow on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shifrasamuel/), a creative that has lived in California, Amsterdam and Singapore and always has something somewhat interesting to share. The experiment is simple, all you need is Excel and the will to do it 🚀 

<p>&nbsp;<p>
 
### The step-by-step guide
  
  1. Open an Excel spreadsheet.
  2. Draw a table that shows **daily time** (hours or half hours) and **weekdays**.
  3. List all your **activity categories** (i.e. exercise, work, social life, reading, creativity) and give a **color** to each one.
  4. Begin your time tracking and **keep it up**.

  This is what's beggining to look like for me:

⚠️ Remember, this is a tool to understand **how you currently use your time**, and later detect what activities you feel you should increase/decrease your time investment in, **and do it:** _Time Optimization_ at its best.

In a couple of weeks you'll begin to see your true colors!👋
