### ¬¥Time is your most precious asset¬¥

And the most ephemeral without a doubt ü¶ã. The fact that I have limited time on this earth has always concerned me and made me extremely aware of the hour, place and activity I was performing at any given situation (let's not forget that feeling of "I am not doing enough and time just slips away!"). Fortunately, as I've grown a little bit older I've learnt to enjoy the present moment and use my time more **wisely and mindfully**. 

### Running the experiment

With that goal in mind, I've decided to track my time in a very visual way so I will be able to see patterns in my use of this precious asset and make decisions accordingly. Basically what technology consultants call _data visualization_ and _data-driven decision making_. You got to love it.





A couple of months ago I To link to another note, you can use regular [Markdown syntax](htps://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a link to a note about cats](/cats){: .internal-link}. Don't forget to use the `.internal-link` class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link.

Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: <a class="internal-link" href="/cats">This is the same note about cats as above</a>.

Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: [this is a link to Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/). Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer.

Additionally, you can use Roam/wiki-style link syntax by wrapping a note's title in double brackets, like this: [[A note about cats]]. If the Roam-style link does not point to a valid note's title, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[There is no note with this title]].

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[A note about cats]]

### Images

Finally, you can display images using Markdown syntax, like this:
